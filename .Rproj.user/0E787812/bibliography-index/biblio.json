            "abstract": "Background With recent improvements in vaccines and treatments against viral hepatitis, an improved understanding of the burden of viral hepatitis is needed to inform global intervention strategies. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to estimate morbidity and mortality for acute viral hepatitis, and for cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by viral hepatitis, by age, sex, and country from 1990 to 2013. Methods We estimated mortality using natural history models for acute hepatitis infections and GBD’s cause-of-death ensemble model for cirrhosis and liver cancer. We used meta-regression to estimate total cirrhosis and total liver cancer prevalence, as well as the proportion of cirrhosis and liver cancer attributable to each cause. We then estimated cause-specific prevalence as the product of the total prevalence and the proportion attributable to a specific cause. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). Findings Between 1990 and 2013, global viral hepatitis deaths increased from 089 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 086–094) to 145 million (138–154); YLLs from 310 million (296–326) to 416 million (391–447); YLDs from 065 million (045–089) to 087 million (061–118); and DALYs from 317 million (302–333) to 425 million (399–456). In 2013, viral hepatitis was the seventh (95% UI seventh to eighth) leading cause of death worldwide, compared with tenth (tenth to 12th) in 1990. Interpretation Viral hepatitis is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Unlike most communicable diseases, the absolute burden and relative rank of viral hepatitis increased between 1990 and 2013. The enormous health loss attributable to viral hepatitis, and the availability of effective vaccines and treatments, suggests an important opportunity to improve public health.

Aim: To determine the survival time of Treponema pallidum in banked donor blood. Material and Methods: Two groups of male Wistar rats (group A and B) were inoculated intratesticularly with 0.5ml of artificially infected donor blood (final density of Nichols treponemes: 5×105/ml) stored at 4°C for various periods of time. In group A, a pair each of the rats was injected every 12 hours, starting at 0 hr, up to a maximal storage time of 96 hr. In group B, the rats were injected after 72, 120, 192 and 336 hours of storage of the treponemes-blood mixture. Group C which is a control group was injected with blood only, while group D rats were injected with heat-killed treponemes suspended in blood every 12 hours. The detection of Treponema pallidum IgG/IgM was based on the principle of double antigen sandwich immunoassay, in which purified recombinant antigens are employed sufficiently to identify antibodies to Syphilis. The outcomes of interest included the proportion of Syphilis positive rats and the maximal survival hours of T. pallidum in banked blood. Results: 14 rats (77.8%) out of the 18 rats that were involved in group A developed orchitis and positive serology up to 72 hours of storage time, p<0.05. 2 rats (25%) in group B developed orchitis after 72hrs of storage time. All the 18 rats (100%) in the control group C and D showed neither clinical nor serological changes. Conclusion: It was concluded that the survival time of T. pallidum in banked donor blood lies between 72-120hrs in this study. Regardless of blood banking temperature, T. pallidum and other transfusion transmissible infections should be screened for prior to allogeneic transfusion.",

            "abstract": "Background Transfusion-transmitted malaria is a frequent but neglected adverse event in Ghana. We did a randomised controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a whole blood pathogen reduction technology at preventing transfusion transmission of Plasmodium spp parasites. Methods For this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial, eligible adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with blood group O+, who required up to two whole blood unit transfusions within 3 days of randomisation and were anticipated to remain in hospital for at least 3 consecutive days after initial transfusion, were enrolled from Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. The main exclusion criteria were symptoms of clinical malaria, antimalaria treatment within 7 days before randomisation, fever, and haemorrhage expected to require transfusion with up to two units of whole blood during the 3 days following study entry. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 by computer-generated permuted block randomisation (block size four) list to receive transfusion with either pathogen-reduced whole blood (treated) or whole blood prepared and transfused by standard local practice (untreated). Patients, health-care providers, and data collectors were masked to treatment allocation. Patients in both groups received up to two whole blood unit transfusions that were retrospectively tested for parasitaemia. Pre-transfusion and post-transfusion blood samples (taken on days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 28) were tested for presence and amount of parasite genome, and assessed for haematological and biochemical parameters. The primary endpoint was the incidence of transfusion-transmitted malaria in non-parasitaemic recipients exposed to parasitaemic whole blood, defined as two consecutive parasitaemic post-transfusion samples with parasite allelic matching, assessed at 1-7 days after transfusion. Secondary endpoints included haematological parameters and a safety analysis of adverse events in patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02118428, and with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201406000777310. Findings Between March 12, 2014, and Nov 7, 2014, 227 patients were enrolled into the study, one of whom was subsequently excluded because she did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the 226 randomised patients, 113 were allocated to receive treated whole blood and 113 to receive standard untreated whole blood. 223 patients (111 treated and 112 untreated) received study-related transfusions, whereas three patients (two treated and one untreated) did not. 214 patients (107 treated and 107 untreated) completed the protocol as planned and comprised the per-protocol population. Overall, 65 non-parasitaemic patients (28 treated and 37 untreated) were exposed to parasitaemic blood. The incidence of transfusion-transmitted malaria was significantly lower for the pathogen-reduced (treated) patients (1 [4%] of 28 patients) than the untreated group (8 [22%] of 37 patients) in this population (p=0039). Overall, 92 (41%) of 223 patients reported 145 treatment-related emergent adverse events during the conduct of the study, with a similar incidence of adverse events between groups receiving untreated or treated whole blood. No transfusion-related deaths occurred in the trial. Interpretation Treatment of whole blood with the Mirasol pathogen reduction system for whole blood reduced the incidence of transfusion-transmitted malaria. The primary endpoint of the study was achieved in the population of non-parasitaemic patients receiving parasitaemic whole blood. The safety profile and clinical outcomes were similar across the two treatment groups. Funding Terumo BCT Inc.",

            "abstract": "Objectives: To collect information on pathogen reduction applied to whole blood. Background: Pathogen reduction (PR) of blood components has been developed over the past two decades, and pathogen-reduced fresh-frozen plasma and platelet concentrates are currently in clinical use. High cost and incomplete coverage of components make PR out of reach for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, should PR become applicable to whole blood (WB), the main product transfused in sub-Saharan Africa, and be compatible with the preparation of clinically suitable components, cost would be minimised, and a range of safety measures in place at high cost in developed areas would become redundant. Methods: All articles called with “pathogen reduction”, “pathogen inactivation” and “whole blood” were retrieved from Medline. References in articles were utilised. Results: One such PR technology (PRT) applied to WB has been developed and has shown efficacious against viruses, bacteria and parasites in vitro; and has been able to inactivate nucleated blood cells whilst retaining the ability to prepare components with acceptable characteristics. The efficacy of this WB PRT has been demonstrated in vivo using the inactivation of Plasmodium falciparum as a model and showing a high degree of correlation between in vitro and in vivo data. Obtaining further evidence of efficacy on other suitable targets is warranted. Shortening of the process, which is currently around 50 min, or increasing the number of units simultaneously processed would be necessary to make PRT WB conducive to LMIC blood services’ needs. Conclusions: Even if not 100% effective against agents that are present in high pathogen load titres, WB PRT could massively impact blood safety in LMIC by providing safer products at an affordable cost.",

Objective: To assess the level of transfusion related sepsis and the bacterial types responsible for the contamination at the Tamale Teaching Hospital in Ghana. Method: We sampled 80 refrigerated donor blood at the blood bank and cultured them for bacteria. The antimicrobial sensitivities of the isolates were also determined. Results: 14 blood bags representing 17.5% grew isolates of various bacteria. Ten (10) of the 14 isolates were Gram positive cocci representing 71.42% making it the commonest contaminant. 50% of the gram positive cocci were identified to be coagulase negative staphylococci and 21.42% were Staphylococcus aureus. There were 14.28% isolates which were Gram positive rods, and were identified to be Corynebacterium diphtheroids. There were two isolates which were Gram negative rods; one was identified as Escherichia coli and the other one Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sensitivity among the organisms were varied; as all the 14 (100%) of the organisms isolated were sensitive to amikacin, only 14.28% of the coagulase negative staphylococci were sensitive to co-trimoxazole, 28.5% were sensitive to ampicillin, 42.8% were sensitive to cefuroxime and 71.4% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Sensitivity to gentamicin was observed to be 85.7% and 28.5% were sensitive to Tetracycline. Only the 10 Gram positive cocci were tested against erythromycin and Cloxacillin; where 70.00% were sensitive to cloxacillin and 90% were sensitive to erythromycin. Conclusion: All the Staphylococcus aureus isolated were resistant to both ampicillin and cotrimoxazole. Potential dangers and consequences of transfusing multidrug resistance bacteria have been discussed.",

            "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Most countries test donations for HIV, HCV and HBV using serology with or without nucleic acid testing (NAT). Cost-utility analyses provide information on the relative value of different screening options. The aim of this project was to develop an open access risk assessment and cost-utility analysis web-tool for assessing HIV, HCV and HBV screening options (http://www.isbtweb.org/working-parties/transfusion-transmitted-infectious-diseases/). An analysis for six countries (Brazil, Ghana, the Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand and USA) was conducted. Materials and Methods: Four strategies; (1) antibody assays (Abs) for HIV and HCV + HBsAg, (2) antibody assays that include antigens for HIV and HCV (Combo) + HBsAg, (3) NAT in minipools of variable size (MP NAT) and (4) individual donation (ID) NAT can be evaluated using the tool. Country-specific data on donors, donation testing results, recipient outcomes and costs are entered using the online interface. Results obtained include the number infections interdicted using each screening options, and the (incremental and average) cost-utility of the options. Results: In each of the six countries evaluated, the use of antibody assays is cost effective or even cost saving. NAT has varying cost-utility depending on the setting, and where adopted, the incremental cost-utility exceeds any previously defined or proposed threshold in each country. Conclusion: The web-tool allows an assessment of infectious units interdicted and value for money of different testing strategies. Regardless of gross national income (GNI) per capita, countries appear willing to dedicate healthcare resources to blood supply safety in excess of that for other sectors of health care.",

            "abstract": "Blood safety remains an important public health concern in Africa where lack of availability or provision of unsafe blood adversely impacts morbidity and mortality in the region. In recognition of this shortfall, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a goal of regional blood safety by 2012 through improved \"organization and management, blood donor recruitment and collection, testing of donor blood as well as appropriate clinical use of blood\" (Tagny et al: Transfusion. 2008;48:1256-1261; Tapko et al: Status of Blood Safety in the WHO African Region: Report of the 2006 Survey http://www.afro.who.int/en/divisions-a-programmes/dsd/health-technologies-a-laboratories.html. Brazzaville, Republic of Congo: WHO Regional Office for Africa; 2006). Although there has been substantial progress toward meeting these objectives, there are continued obstacles to both development and sustainability. In a setting where transfusion oversight is still being improved, transfusion-transmitted infections are of real concern. The high prevalence of some transfusion-transmissible agents such as hepatitis B virus and HIV in the general population means that some infected blood units escape detection by even well-performed laboratory testing, resulting in potential downstream transmission to patients. The spectrum of transfusion-transmitted infection include conventional as well as exotic pathogens, many of which are endemic to the region, thereby imparting ongoing challenges to recruitment and testing strategies.  2012 Elsevier Inc.",

            "abstract": "Background: Bacterial contamination of blood components (notably platelets) remains a leading infectious risk to the blood supply. There has been extensive research in high-income countries to characterize the risk of bacterial contamination along with adoption of strategies to mitigate that risk. By contrast, related data in Africa are lacking. Study Design and Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to members of African Society of Blood Transfusion to assess existing or planned measures at African blood centers and hospitals to mitigate bacterial contamination of blood products. A literature review of studies pertaining to related transfusion-associated risk in Africa was conducted to complement the findings. Results: Forty-five responses were received, representing 16 African countries. All respondents were urban, either in blood centers (n = 36) or hospital-based transfusion services (n = 9). Reported measures included skin disinfection (n = 41 [91.1%]); diversion pouches (n = 14 [31.1%]); bacterial culture (n = 9 [20%]); pathogen reduction (PR) (n = 3 [6.7%]); and point-of-release testing (PoRT) (n = 2 [4.4%]). Measures being considered for implementation included: skin disinfection (n = 2 [4.4%]); diversion pouches (n = 2 [4.4%]); bacterial culture n = 14 (31.1%); PR (n = 11 [24.4%]); and PoRT (n = 4 [8.9%]). Of the 38 respondents who reported collection of platelets, 14 (36.8%) and 8 (21.1%) reported using diversion pouches and bacterial culture, respectively. The literature review identified 36 studies on the epidemiology of bacterial contamination and septic transfusion reactions in Africa; rates of contamination ranged from 0% to 17.9%. Conclusions: The findings suggest that prevention of bacterial contamination of blood components and transfusion-associated sepsis in Africa remains neglected. Regional preventive measures have not been widely adopted.",

Clinical trials and haemovigilance programmes suggest the observed loss of potency is of little clinical significance, with some technology-specific exceptions. Concerns over adverse toxicological effects or neoantigen formation have not been confirmed for currently licensed products. Conclusion While platelet PI has been adopted to reduce bacterial contamination, the ability of PI methods to replace testing for emerging bloodborne infections, or as a substitute for selective pathogen testing, gamma-irradiation or even leucodepletion, make adoption of PI for components increasingly attractive.  2012 International Society of Blood Transfusion.",

            "abstract": "Background Despite the high burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in sub-Saharan Africa, absence of widespread screening and poor access to treatment leads to most people remaining undiagnosed until later stages of disease when prognosis is poor and treatment options are limited. We examined the cost-effectiveness of community-based screening and early treatment with antiviral therapy for HBV in The Gambia. Methods In this economic evaluation, we combined a decision tree with a Markov state transition model to compare a screen and treat intervention consisting of adult community-based screening using a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rapid test and subsequent HBV antiviral therapy versus current practice, in which there is an absence of publicly provided screening or treatment for HBV. We used data from the PROLIFICA study to parameterise epidemiological, primary screening, and cost information, and other model parameter inputs were obtained from a literature search. Outcome measures were cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted; cost per life-year saved; and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between current practice and the screen and treat intervention. Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective. Costs (expressed in 2013 US$) and health outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Findings In The Gambia, where the prevalence of HBsAg is 88% in people older than 30 years, adult screening and treatment for HBV has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $540 per DALY averted, $645 per life-year saved, and $511 per QALY gained, compared with current practice. These ICERs are in line with willingness-to-pay levels of one times the country’s gross domestic product per capita ($487) per DALY averted, and remain robust over a wide range of epidemiological and cost parameter inputs. Interpretation Adult community-based screening and treatment for HBV in The Gambia is likely to be a cost-effective intervention. Higher cost-effectiveness might be achievable with targeted facility-based screening, price reductions of drugs and diagnostics, and integration of HBV screening with other public health interventions.

Because of the potential broad-spectrum risk reduction capability of PRT, the health economics of PRT could be an important consideration in decision making for this technology.\\backslashn\\backslashnSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Decision analytic models comparing current blood safety screens and interventions to riboflavin-based whole blood PRT (currently in development) and separately to platelets (PLTs)-and-plasma PRT from the health care system perspective in Canada were used to assess the cost-utility of PRT in reducing the following adverse events: human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human T-lymphotropic virus, syphilis, West Nile virus, bacteria, Chikungunya virus, cytomegalovirus, Trypanosoma cruzi, graft-versus-host disease, febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, and transfusion-related immunomodulation. PRT was modeled as an addition to rather than a replacement for current interventions. The potential of PRT to reduce the risk of an unknown pathogen was not assessed.\\backslashn\\backslashnRESULTS: Whole blood PRT was estimated to have a cost-effectiveness of $1,276,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY; 95% confidence interval [CI] approximation, 600,000-3,313,000) compared to current screens and interventions. PLTs-and-plasma PRT was estimated to have a cost-effectiveness of $1,423,000/QALY (95% CI approximation, 834,000-2,818,000) on an all-transfusions basis.\\backslashn\\backslashnCONCLUSIONS: Because of the complexity of transfusion risks and practices, the cost-effectiveness of whole blood or PLTs-and-plasma PRT can be modeled provided that assumptions and simplifications are made. Uncertainty remains with respect to the risk reduction that can be achieved for some adverse events. Nevertheless, the results of this cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to inform policy decisions regarding PRT technology in the context of other initiatives designed to improve transfusion safety.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this report is to provide an overview of the current status and trends in blood supply, safety, sufficiency and usage globally. The report is primarily based on data for the year 2013, which were reported by 156 of 195 Member States to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Database on Blood Safety (GDBS). To give a more complete overview of the global situation, data for 2012 from 15 countries and for 2011 from nine countries were used where 2013 data were not available.1 These 180 countries account for a total population of 7 billion, representing 98.3% of the global population. The WHO GDBS was established in 1998 to provide data about the availability, safety and accessibility of blood for transfusion. The main objective of the survey is to collect and analyse data on national blood systems from all countries as the basis for effective action to improve access to safe blood and blood products and transfusion practices globally. The WHO Blood Transfusion Safety programme has undertaken biennial surveys on the safety and availability of blood in Member States since 1998. Since 2006, GDBS data are collected annually using a standardized tool, which is sent to national health authorities or national blood transfusion services for completion. Web-based tools were used for 2011, 2012 and 2013 data collection. Standardized definitions of the terminologies used in the survey questionnaire were prepared to promote consistency of reporting. Where possible, efforts were made to validate the data reported to WHO with WHO regional and country offices, as well as with experts who visited countries on behalf of WHO. Countries were contacted for clarification or correction when discrepancies, inconsistencies or any unusual patterns were observed. Efforts were also made to validate GDBS data by comparing them with data available from other published sources. However, systematic verification was not performed for all data provided by all countries. In particular, answers to the questions on the existence of policies, programmes or mechanisms could be affected by individual interpretation of the questions asked.",

HIV and HCV infections were significantly higher in 1569 replacement donors than in 1169 volunteers; 2.4 and 1.7 versus 0.3 and 0.7% respectively (P < 0.01). Two duplex RNA-positive plasma pools contained a confirmed/seronegative HIV or HCV RNA individual plasma. The residual post-transfusion risk of HIV and HCV infection of blood collected from replacement blood donors ranged between 1:260 and 1:16 393 after screening for anti-HIV, p24 antigen and anti-HCV. These data indicate that in high-prevalence HIV and HCV blood donor populations, a substantial residual post-transfusion risk of infection remains. This risk might be reduced by collecting blood in younger volunteer donors or by genomic screening.",

            "abstract": "Objectives: To describe the progression times of HIV-1 infection from seroconversion to AIDS and to death, and time from first developing AIDS to death in rural Uganda. Also, to describe the proportion of individuals within the cohort dying with AIDS and the CD4 lymphocyte count before death. Design: A prospective, longitudinal, population-based cohort. Methods: Since 1990, 107 HIV-prevalent cases, 168 incident cases and 235 HIV-seronegative controls have been recruited into a cohort in rural Uganda. Participants are recruited from the general population and they are reviewed routinely every 3 months and at other times when ill. Results: The median time from seroconversion to death was 9.8 years. Age over 40 years at seroconversion was associated with more rapid progression (P < 0.001, log rank test). For the first 4 years of the study, HIV contributed little to the death rates in the HIV incident cases, but after 5 years, the contribution of HIV became greater and was particularly marked in the oldest age group. Survival rates in the cohort were similar to those in the general population. The median time from seroconversion to AIDS was 9.4 years and from AIDS to death was 9.2 months. Of those infected with HIV-1,80% died with AIDS and 20% had a CD4 count < 10 × 106 cells/l. Conclusions: Survival with HIV-1 infection is similar in Africa to industrialized countries before the use of antiretroviral therapy; when they do die, many of those in Africa are severely immunosuppressed and most have clinical features of AIDS.  2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",

            "abstract": "Objectives: Areas with high HIV-incidence rates compared to the developed world may benefit from additional testing in blood banks and may show more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adding p24 antigen, mini pool nucleic acid amplification testing (MP-NAT), or individual donation NAT (ID-NAT) to the HIV-antibody screening at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (Accra, Ghana), where currently only HIV-antibody screening is undertaken. Methods: The residual risk of HIV transmission was derived from blood donations to the blood bank of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in 2004. Remaining life expectancies of patients receiving blood transfusion were estimated using the World Health Organization life expectancies. Cost-effectiveness ratios for adding the tests to HIV-antibody screening only were determined using a decision tree model and a Markov model for HIV. Results: The prevalence of HIV was estimated at 1.51% in 18,714 donations during 2004. The incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted was US$1237 for p24 antigen, US$3142 for MP-NAT and US$7695 compared to the next least expensive strategy. HIV-antibody screening itself was cost-saving compared to no screening at all, gaining US$73.85 and averting 0.86 DALY per transfused patient. Up to a willingness-to-pay of US$2736 per DALY averted, HIV-antibody screening without additional testing was the most cost-effective strategy. Over a willingness-to-pay of US$11,828 per DALY averted, ID-NAT was significantly more cost-effective than the other strategies. Conclusions: Adding p24 antigen, MP-NAT, or ID-NAT to the current antibody screening cannot be regarded as a cost-effective health-care intervention for Ghana.

            "abstract": "Background. Methylene blue and visible light treatment and quarantine are two methods used to reduce adverse events, mostly infections, associated with the transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma. The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the budget impact and cost-utility of these two methods from a payer’s perspective. Materials and methods. A budget impact and cost-utility model simulating the risks of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, a West Nile virus-like infection, allergic reactions and febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions achieved using plasma treated with methylene blue and visible light (MBP) and quarantine plasma (QP) was constructed for Spain. QP costs were estimated using data from one blood centre in Spain and published literature. The costs of producing fresh-frozen plasma from whole blood, apheresis plasma, and multicomponent apheresis, and separately for passive and active methods of donor recall for QP were included. Costs and outcomes over a 5-year and lifetime time horizon were estimated. Results. Compared to passive QP, MBP led to a net increase of € 850,352, and compared to active QP, MBP led to a net saving of € 5,890,425 over a 5-year period. Compared to passive QP, MBP increased the cost of fresh-frozen plasma per patient by € 7.21 and had an incremental cost-utility ratio of € 705,126 per quality-adjusted life-year. Compared to active QP, MBP reduced cost by € 50.46 per patient and was more effective. Discussion. Plasma collection method and quarantine approach had the strongest influence on the budget impact and cost-utility of MBP. If QP relies on plasma from whole blood collection and passive quarantine, it is less costly than MBP. However, MPB was estimated to be more effective than QP in all analyses.",

The prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products in Ghana is not known. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products at the three major blood transfusion centers in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Stored whole blood and its products were cultured on different media, and isolates were identified using standard biochemical and bacteriological methods. The susceptibility of the isolates to selected antimicrobial agents was also determined by the disc diffusion method. The overall prevalence rate was 9% (28/303; whole blood, 13% [24/192]; plasma, 3% [2/79]; platelet, 9% [2/22]). The Gram-positive bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, S. aureus, and Bacillus spp., and the Gram-negative organisms were Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to cloxacillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin but resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, and cotrimoxazole, while the Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to amikacin and gentamicin but resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime (except Y. enterocolitica), and cotrimoxazole. Our results suggest that bacterial contamination of blood and its products is prevalent in Ghana.",

            "abstract": "The hypothesis that experimentally determined survival times of Treponema pallidum in stored donorblood could be related to the number of treponemes initially present in the treponeme‐blood mixtures was investigated by inoculating rabbits with three graded doses of treponemes suspended in donor blood and stored at 4°C for various periods of time. The storage periods up to which living treponemes could be detected in the testes of the inoculated rabbits as well as those storage periods up to which seroconversion occurred are related to the number of treponemes present in the treponeme‐blood mixtures. Increasing numbers of treponemes present in the donor blood resulted in longer periods up to which positive results in both parameters were found. All available evidence suggests that the upper limit of seroconversion coincides with the upper limit of treponemal survival. Inoculation with 5times104 treponemes per ml of donor blood resulted in a treponemal survival time of 48 h, inoculation with 1.25times106 treponemes per ml in a treponemal survival time of 72 h and inoculation with 2.5times107 treponemes per ml donor blood in a survival time of 120 h.  1985 Blackwell Publishing Ltd",

            "abstract": "Decision-analytic software commonly used to implement discrete Markov models requires transitions to occur between simulated health states either at the beginning or at the end of each cycle. The result is an over- or underestimation, respectively, of quality-adjusted life expectancy and cost, compared with the results that would be obtained if transitions were modeled to occur randomly throughout each cycle. The standard half-cycle correction (HCC) is used to remedy the bias. However, the standard approach to the HCC is problematic: It does not account for discounting or for the shape of intermediate state membership functions. Application of the standard approach to the HCC also has no numerical effect on the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or change in net health benefit under certain circumstances. Alternatives to the standard HCC, in order of ease of use, include no correction, the life-table approach, the cycle-tree method, and a correction based on Simpson’s rule. For less complex decision models in which the computational burden is not large, reducing the cycle length to a month or less and using no correction should result in small estimation biases. With more complex models, where cycle lengths larger than 1 month may be necessary to make computation feasible, we recommend the cycle tree approach. The latter is relatively easy to apply and has an intuitive appeal: Hypothetical subjects who transition from one state to another, on average halfway through a cycle, should receive half of the value associated with the state from which they come and half the value of the state to which they are going.

            "abstract": "SUMMARY: Background: Misuse of blood by clinicians was suggested to explain blood shortage in sub-Saharan Africa although based on little evidence. This study evaluated whether routine halving (restricted) of blood requests was justified. Study design and methods: On alternated days for 3months in 2011-2012, restricted or full blood product supply [whole blood (WB), red cell concentrate (RCC)] was provided to the Obstetrics & Gynaecology department (O&G). Patient age, haemoglobin (Hb) level pre- and post-transfusion, clinical condition, blood products request and supply, transfused and returned, clinical outcome were collated. Results: Five hundred and nineteen patients (249 restricted and 270 full supply) received 1001 blood products (946% WB, 64% RCC). Clinical conditions were severe peri-partum bleeding (724%) requiring emergency transfusion (82%) whilst 276% of total transfusion was for anaemia, 18% being moderate (8-10gdL-1). Pre-transfusion Hb level was <6gdL-1 in 367%, 6-8gdL-1 291% and ≥8gdL-1 in 332% of cases. Fifty-five percent of the transfused blood was stored ≤1week. Restricted supply triggered additional request (40%) compared to 10% in full supply mode. Whether with restricted or full supply, blood requests, supply and units transfused/patient were similar (restricted 23 and 21unitpatient-1 and full 29 and 23unitpatient-1, respectively). Fatal clinical outcome was 31% evenly distributed between supply modes and transfusion reactions 08%. Conclusions: O&G clinicians order blood according to clinical need and transfuse 85% of the products supplied. Product supply did not significantly affect use although appropriateness of transfusion was difficult to assess.  2013 British Blood Transfusion Society.",

Additionally, Plasmodium DNA was screened for using a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a Pan-Plasmodium quantitative PCR. Donor-recipient parasite identity was defined by two concordant genotyping strategies.\\backslashn\\backslashnRESULTS: Plasmodium antibody prevalence was 100% in both donors and recipients, with at least one antigen. Parasitemia prevalence was 54.7% in both donors and recipients with median levels of 20 and 5.3 copies/\\muL, respectively, the difference being correlated to age (p = 0.0001). Multiple species infections were frequent (8.5%). Twenty-four units of parasitemic blood were transfused to nonparasitemic recipients, of which 10 (41.7%) became infected after transfusion. Molecular genotyping with 13 distinct markers (antigenic genes and microsatellite loci) identified three to nine parasitemic recipients after transfusion with level of allelic identity suggesting 14% to 28% definite or possible transfusion-related parasitemia.\\backslashn\\backslashnCONCLUSION: None of the currently available screening assays appear suitable to minimize transfusion malaria without compromising the blood supply in endemic areas.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To implement and describe a novel syphilis screening strategy for blood donors. BACKGROUND: The seroprevalence of syphilis in blood donors is often high in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) although the proportion of infectious donations is probably low. Syphilis screening may not happen at all; or the use of non-specific screening tests, which have high false positive rates, results in many donations being discarded unnecessarily. This can have a critical effect on already inadequate blood supplies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood donors were screened at the time of donation with an anti-treponemal rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and blood collected irrespective of the result. Units screening negative for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C were released to stock. RDT screen-positive units were re-tested with rapid plasma reagin (RPR) - units testing negative were released to stock and test-positive units discarded. RESULTS: Of the 2213 blood donors, 182 (8.2%; 182/2213) screened positive by RDT. In addition, 38 out of these 182 (20.9%) were RPR positive on post-donation testing. Over 2 months there was a 79% reduction in blood units discarded due to a positive syphilis screen. CONCLUSION: In other LMIC, this novel strategy can contribute to improving blood safety without jeopardising blood supply",

            "abstract": "Background: The recently launched nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir represents a significant turn in the treatment paradigm of chronic hepatitis C. While effective, sofosbuvir is also associated with a considerable cost. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of sofosbuvir-containing regimens in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 5 (HCV-G5) mono-infection in South Africa (SA). Design: We constructed a lifetime horizon decision-analytic Markov model of the natural history of HCV infection to evaluate the cost effectiveness of sofosbuvir–ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) monotherapy against sofosbuvir triple therapy (SOF-TT) (sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon and ribavirin [peg-INF/RBV]) and the current standard of care (SOC) (peg-INF/RBV) for patients with chronic HCV-G5 in the South African context. The model was populated with data from published literature, expert opinion and South African private sector cost data. The price modelled for sofosbuvir was the predicted South African private sector price of 82,129.32 South African rand (R) (US$7000) for 12 weeks. The analysis was conducted from a third-party payer perspective. Outcome Measures: The outcome measures were discounted and undiscounted costs (in 2015 South African rand and US dollars) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Outcomes from the cost-effectiveness model show that SOF/LDV yields the most favourable future health economic outcomes compared with SOF-TT and the current SOC in SA. Findings relating to the lifetime incremental cost per QALY gained for patients infected with HCV-G5 indicate that SOF/LDV dominated both SOF-TT and SOC, i.e. SOF/LDV is less costly and more effective. Conclusion: Outcomes from this analysis suggest that at a price of R123,190 ($US10,500) for 12 weeks of SOF/LDV might be cost effective for South African patients infected with HCV-G5.",

            "abstract": "Transfusion-transmitted infection risk remains an enduring challenge to blood safety in Africa. A high background incidence and prevalence of the major transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), dependence on high-risk donors to meet demand, suboptimal testing and quality assurance collectively contribute to the increased risk. With few exceptions, donor testing is confined to serological evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV) and syphilis. Barriers to implementation of broader molecular methods include cost, limited infrastructure and lack of technical expertise. Pathogen reduction (PR), a term used to describe a variety of methods (e.g. solvent detergent treatment or photochemical activation) that may be applied to blood following collection, offers the means to diminish the infectious potential of multiple pathogens simultaneously. This is effective against different classes of pathogen, including the major TTIs where laboratory screening is already implemented (e.g. HIV, HBV and HCV) as well pathogens that are widely endemic yet remain unaddressed (e.g. malaria, bacterial contamination). We sought to review the available and emerging PR techniques and their potential application to resource-constrained parts of Africa, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of such technologies. PR has been slow to be adopted even in high-income countries, primarily given the high costs of use. Logistical considerations, particularly in low-resourced parts of Africa, also raise concerns about practicality. Nonetheless, PR offers a rational, innovative strategy to contend with TTIs; technologies in development may well present a viable complement or even alternative to targeted screening in the future.",

Methods: Systematic searches of PubMed and Scopus were undertaken to identify prospective studies recruiting adults (> 13 years) with community-acquired sepsis in sSA post-2000. Random effects meta-analysis of in-hospital and 30-day mortality was undertaken and available aetiology data also summarised by random effects meta-analysis. Results: Fifteen studies of 2800 participants were identified. Inclusion criteria were heterogeneous. The majority of patients were HIV-infected, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the most common cause of blood stream infection where sought. Pooled in-hospital mortality for Sepsis-2-defined sepsis and severe sepsis was 19% (95% CI 12-29%) and 39% (95% CI 30-47%) respectively, and sepsis mortality was associated with the proportion of HIV-infected participants. Mortality and morbidity data beyond 30 days were absent. Conclusions: Sepsis in sSA is dominated by HIV and tuberculosis, with poor outcomes. Optimal antimicrobial strategies, including the role of tuberculosis treatment, are unclear. Long-term outcome data are lacking. Standardised sepsis diagnostic criteria that are easily applied in low-resource settings are needed to establish an evidence base for sepsis management in sSA.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Syphilis testing conventionally relies on a combination of non-treponemal and treponemal tests. The primary objective of this study was to describe the positive predictive value (PPV) of a screening algorithm in a combination of a treponemal rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Ghana. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 2014 to January 2015, 5 mL of venous blood samples were taken from 16 016 blood donors and tested with a treponemal RDT; 5 mL of venous blood was taken from 526 consenting initial syphilis sero-reactive blood donors. These RDT reactive samples were confirmed with an algorithm, applying the Vitros((R)) /Abbott-Architect((R)) algorithm as gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 478 of 526 RDT reactive donors were confirmed positive for syphilis, making a PPV of 90.9%. Of the 172 (32.7%) donors who were also RPR positive, 167 were confirmed, resulting in a PPV of 97.1%. The PPV of the combined RDT and RPR (suspected active syphilis) testing algorithm was highest among donors at an enhanced risk of syphilis, family/replacement donors (99.9%), and among voluntary donors above 25 years (98.6%). DISCUSSION: Screening of blood donors by combining syphilis RDT and RPR with relatively good PPV may provide a reasonable technology for LMIC that has a limited capacity for testing and can contribute to the improvement of blood safety with a minimal loss of donors.",

            "abstract": "Worldwide safety of blood has been positively impacted by technological, economic and social improvements; nevertheless, growing socio-political changes of contemporary society together with environmental changes challenge the practice of blood transfusion with a continuous source of unforeseeable threats with the emergence and re-emergence of blood-borne pathogens. Pathogen reduction (PR) is a proactive strategy to mitigate the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. PR technologies for the treatment of single plasma units and platelet concentrates are commercially available and have been successfully implemented in more than 2 dozen countries worldwide. Ideally, all labile blood components should be PR treated to ensure a safe and sustainable blood supply in accordance with regional transfusion best practices. Recently, a device (Mirasol  Pathogen Reduction Technology System) for PR treatment of whole blood using riboflavin and UV light has received CE marking, a significant step forward in realising blood safety where WB transfusion is the norm, such as in sub-Saharan Africa and in far-forward combat situations. There is also keen interest in the ability to derive components from Mirasol  -treated whole blood, as it is seen as a more efficient and economical means to implement universal PR in the blood centre environment than treatment of components with different PR systems.",

            "abstract": "The use of blood components has been a staple of transfusion medicine for several decades. Technologies for the processing and handling of blood, including separation of components from whole blood, are very well developed. Relative to blood safety, methods to detect the presence of pathogens and reduce the levels of donor white blood cells from whole blood are also well established in routine practice. The advantages which exist for the handling of whole blood by these methods have, for various reasons, not extended to the field of pathogen reduction technology (PRT). PRT methods have been developed and are now in routine use in various locations for addressing single donor or pooled plasma and platelet products. Several methods have also been in experimental development for the treatment of red blood cells as a separate component. The ability to treat whole blood in a fashion that would allow a single pathogen reduction and white blood cell inactivation step, to be followed by use of the product in the form of whole blood or separation into components, would afford several benefits from both a logistical and practical standpoint.

            "abstract": "Background: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study assesses health losses from diseases, injuries, and risk factors using disability-adjusted life-years, which need a set of disability weights to quantify health levels associated with non-fatal outcomes. The objective of this study was to estimate disability weights for the GBD 2013 study. Methods: We analysed data from new web-based surveys of participants aged 18-65 years, completed in four European countries (Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden) between Sept 23, 2013, and Nov 11, 2013, combined with data previously collected in the GBD 2010 disability weights measurement study. Surveys used paired comparison questions for which respondents considered two hypothetical individuals with different health states and specified which person they deemed healthier than the other. These surveys covered 183 health states pertinent to GBD 2013; of these states, 30 were presented with descriptions revised from previous versions and 18 were new to GBD 2013. We analysed paired comparison data using probit regression analysis and rescaled results to disability weight units between 0 (no loss of health) and 1 (loss equivalent to death). We compared results with previous estimates, and an additional analysis examined sensitivity of paired comparison responses to duration of hypothetical health states. Findings: The total analysis sample consisted of 30 230 respondents from the GBD 2010 surveys and 30 660 from the new European surveys. For health states common to GBD 2010 and GBD 2013, results were highly correlated overall (Pearson’s r 0992 [95% uncertainty interval 0989-0994]). For health state descriptions that were revised for this study, resulting disability weights were substantially different for a subset of these weights, including those related to hearing loss (eg, complete hearing loss: GBD 2010 0033 [0020-0052]; GBD 2013 0215 [0144-0307]) and treated spinal cord lesions (below the neck: GBD 2010 0047 [0028-0072]; GBD 2013 0296 [0198-0414]; neck level: GBD 2010 0369 [0243-0513]; GBD 2013 0589 [0415-0748]). Survey responses to paired comparison questions were insensitive to whether the comparisons were framed in terms of temporary or chronic outcomes (Pearson’s r 0981 [0973-0987]). Interpretation: This study substantially expands the empirical basis for assessment of non-fatal outcomes in the GBD study. Findings from this study substantiate the notion that disability weights are sensitive to particular details in descriptions of health states, but robust to duration of outcomes.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Blood transfusions carry the risk of transmitting infections. This risk has been studied in detail in high-income countries but not in sub-Saharan Africa. This study estimates the risks of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) from a single unit of blood in sub-Saharan Africa. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A mathematical model was constructed to quantify transfusion risks across 45 sub-Saharan African countries using three components: the risk of a contaminated unit entering the blood supply, the risk that the unit will be given to a susceptible patient, and the risk that receipt of the unit will lead to infection in the recipient. Variables included prevalence of infection in donors, extent of blood testing, test sensitivity, and susceptibility of recipients. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region and a systematic review of the literature were used to parameterize the model. Uncertainty in the risk estimates was quantified using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The median overall risks of becoming infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV from a blood transfusion in sub-Saharan Africa were 1, 4.3, and 2.5 infections per 1000 units, respectively. If annual transfusion requirements projected by the WHO were met, transfusions alone would be responsible for 28,595 HBV infections, 16,625 HCV infections, and 6650 HIV infections every year. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the true risks may be even higher. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to systematically quantify the risks of transfusion-transmitted infections across sub-Saharan Africa.

            "abstract": "Background Asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia has been documented in donor blood in West Africa. However, donated blood is not routinely screened for malaria parasites (MPs). The present study therefore aimed to document the frequency of blood transfusion-induced donor-recipient malaria parasitaemia patterns, in children receiving blood transfusion in a tertiary health-centre. Methodology A cross-sectional, observational study involving 140 children receiving blood transfusion was carried out. Blood donor units and patients’ blood samples were obtained, for the determination of malaria parasites (MPs). Giemsa staining technique was used to determine the presence of malaria parasitaemia. Results Malaria parasites were detected in 7% of donor blood and in 8.3% of the recipients’ pretransfusion blood. The incidence of posttransfusion MPs was 3%, but none of these were consistent with blood transfusion-induced malaria, as no child with posttransfusion parasitaemia was transfused with parasitized donor blood. Majority of the blood transfusions (89.4%) had no MPs in either donors or recipients, while 6.8% had MPs in both donors and recipients, with the remaining 3.8% showing MPs in recipients alone. Conclusion In conclusion, the incidence of posttransfusion malaria parasitaemia appears low under the prevailing circumstances.",

            "abstract": "Background and Methods: Blood transfusion saves lives and improves health but the presence of transfusion transmissible infections can have untoward consequences. When undetected, these infections can cause significant morbidity and mortality to transfusion recipients. On the other hand, a high prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI) leading to rejection of a large proportion of donated blood can result in blood shortages and subsequent increase in mortality. Malaria and bacterial infections are transfusion transmissible but there is limited data concerning these infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the burden of transfusion-transmitted malaria in malaria endemic countries are unknown, it is recommended that all donated blood is screened for malaria parasites and presumptive treatment be given to transfusion recipients. Bacterial contamination in sub-Saharan Africa has been reported to occur in between 8 - 17% of stored blood but the effect of contamination on transfusion recipients has not been determined. Syphilis is currently the only bacterial infection for which routine screening is recommended but screening is not being performed in many blood centres including Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana where this study took place. This study examined the effects of transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) and bacterial infections (including syphilis) on transfusion recipients in a malaria endemic area. Four malaria screening tests were compared to assess their usefulness in the context of African blood banks. Pregnant women, children and immune-compromised transfusion recipients from the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Medicine and Oncology in KATH were enrolled into the study. Results: Anti-malarial drugs were routinely prescribed with paediatric transfusions. Fifty patients were evaluated after receiving blood transfusions that were positive for P. falciparum by PCR and seven recipients developed PCR-detectable parasitaemia. In only one recipient (2%) was TTM confirmed. The prevalence of P. falciparum malaria in transfused blood was 4.7% (21/445) by microscopy, 13.7% (60/440) by rapid diagnostic test, 18% (78/436) by polymerase chain reaction and 22.2% (98/442) by enzyme immunoassay. Bacterial contamination was found in 11.5 %( 95% CI 7.0-16.0%) (23/200) of donated blood units but only half of the recipients were observed to developed adverse signs of transfusion related sepsis. The mean duration of storage of blood was 2 days. The prevalence of syphilis sero-positivity in donated blood was 8.0% (95% CI 4.3-11.7%). Seroconversion took place in an 8 year old girl, after receiving a syphilis sero-positive unit of blood. Conclusions: This thesis has shown that malaria parasites may be commonly detected in donor blood but TTM occurs infrequently in recipients living in malaria endemic areas. The high rate of bacterial contamination and its associated transfusion related sepsis poses a safety risk to transfusion recipients. Transfusion-transmitted syphilis remains a risk for transfusion recipients in blood centres with a high prevalence and short duration of storage of donor blood.",

This study describes the demographic characteristics of blood transfusion recipients and patterns of blood and blood component use in Zimbabwe. Materials and methods. Data on the characteristics of the blood transfusion recipients (age, sex, blood group), blood components received (type, quantity), discharge diagnoses and outcomes following transfusion (discharge status, duration of stay in hospital), were retrospectively collected from four major hospitals for the period from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012. Diagnoses were grouped into broad categories according to the disease headings of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Surgical procedures were grouped into broad categories according to organ system using ICD-9. Results. Most of the 1,793 transfusion recipients studied were female (63.2%) and in the reproductive age group, i.e. 15-49 years (65.3%). The median age of the recipients was 33 years (range, 0-93). The majority of these recipients (n=1,642; 91.6%) received a red blood cell transfusion. The majority of the patients were diagnosed with conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth (22.3%), and diseases of blood and blood-forming organs (17.7%). The median time spent in hospital was 8 days (range, 0-214) and in-hospital mortality was 15.4%. Discussion. Our sample of blood transfusion recipients were fairly young and most of them received red blood cell transfusions. The majority of patients in the reproductive age group received blood transfusions for pregnancy and childbirth-related diagnoses.",

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the efficacy, safety, and cost of 9673 riboflavin and ultraviolet light-treated platelet (PLT) transfusions given to 1211 patients during a 3-year period. The results were compared with the efficacy, safety, and cost of 6424 nontreated PLT transfusions administered to 1500 patients during a 3-year comparison period before PRT implementation. RESULTS Despite a similar PLT transfusion dose per unit for both periods (pre-PRT period 3.26 vs. PRT period 3.19), the mean number of PLT concentrates per patient (4.2 vs. 7.8; p = 0.006) and the total dose of PLTs received by patients were higher in the PRT period (13.6 vs. 24.8; p = 0.0002). Hematology and medical and surgical patient categories had the highest PLT use per patient. However, febrile (2.5% vs. 1.2%; p = 0.02) and allergic (0.16% vs. 0.08%; p = 0.01) reactions were lower during the PRT period. The blood center saved €284,805.58 due to a reduction of outdated PLTs from 16.8% to 0.72% after PRT implementation. CONCLUSIONS Although PRT can improve PLT safety, it can increase the amount of PLTs required for transfusion in some patient categories. The cost of PRT can be partially offset by the savings associated with a lower rate of PLT outdates. This cost reduction can be a key factor in settings where inventory management is challenged by a high percentage of wasted PLTs due to outdating.",

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT in the first year of screening compared with alternatives for the 50 states and separately for Puerto Rico. Design: Microsimulation that captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients, sexual partners, and their infants. Data Sources: National testing results compiled by AABB and costs, utilities, and outcome probabilities estimated from the literature. Target Population: Transfusion recipients. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Universal ID-NAT, universal mini-pool NAT (MP-NAT), and ID-NAT exclusively for components transfused to women of childbearing age. Seasonally targeted strategies in Puerto Rico and geographically targeted strategies in the 50 states were also considered. Outcome Measures: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and outcomes. Results of Base-Case Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT exclusively during high mosquito season was cost-effective at $81 123 per QALY (95% CI, $49 138 to $978 242 per QALY). No screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. Universal ID-NAT cost $341 million per QALY (CI, $125 million to $2.90 billion per QALY) compared with no screening in the 50 states. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT only during the season of high mosquito activity was most cost-effective in 64% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations. In the 50 states, no intervention was cost-effective in 99.99% of iterations. Cost-effectiveness was highly dependent on the rate of assumed infectious donations. Limitation: Data were limited on the component-specific trans-missibility of Zika and long-term sequelae of infection. Conclusion: Screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico, and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. During periods with lower rates of Zika-infectious donations, the cost-effectiveness of screening will be even less favorable. Primary Funding Source: None.",

            "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Monitoring the whole chain of events from the blood donors to recipients, documenting any undesirable or untoward effects and introducing measures to prevent their recurrence if possible are components of haemovigilance systems. Only few sub-Saharan African countries have haemovigilance systems, and there are very little data on adverse events of transfusion. Adverse events monitoring is an integral part of a haemovigilance system. Our study aimed to establish the incidence and types of adverse events of transfusions in Ghana and to identify interventions to improve effectiveness. Materials and Methods: This prospective observational 1-year study enrolled 372 recipients of 432 transfusions in a Ghanaian teaching hospital. Vital signs were monitored at 15, 30 and 60 min intervals during the transfusion, then 8 h until 24 h post-transfusion. Three investigators independently classified any new signs and symptoms according to Serious Hazards of Transfusion definitions. Results: The adverse events incidence was 213% (92/432), predominantly mild acute transfusion reactions (84%). A total of 20 transfusions (46%) were stopped before completion, 60% of them for mild febrile reactions, which could have been managed with transfusion in situ. Conclusion: This prospective study indicates a high incidence of adverse events of transfusion in Kumasi, Ghana. The significant numbers of discontinued transfusions suggest that guidelines on how to manage transfusion reactions would help preserve scarce blood stocks. Gradual implementation of a haemovigilance system, starting with monitoring adverse transfusion events, is a pragmatic approach in resource-limited settings.",

            "abstract": "Background: The pediatric antiretroviral (ARV) market is poorly described in the literature, resulting in gaps in understanding treatment access. We analyzed the pediatric ARV market from 2004 to 2012 and assessed pricing trends and associated factors. Methods: Data on donor funded procurements of pediatric ARV formulations reported to the Global Price Reporting Mechanism database from 2004 to 2012 were analyzed. Outcomes of interest were the volume and mean price per patient-year ARV formulation based on WHO ARV dosing recommendations for a 10kg child. Factors associated with the price of formulations were assessed using linear regression; potential predictors included: country income classification, geographical region, market segment (originator versus generic ARVs), and number of manufacturers per formulation. All analyses were adjusted for type of formulations (single, dual or triple fixed-dose combinations (FDCs)) Results: Data from 111 countries from 2004 to 2012 were included, with procurement of 33 formulations at a total value of USD 204 million. Use of dual and triple FDC formulations increased substantially over time, but with limited changes in price. Upon multivariate analysis, prices of originator formulations were found to be on average 72% higher than generics (p<0.001). A 10% increase in procurement volume was associated with a 1% decrease (p<0.001) in both originator and generic prices. The entry of one additional manufacturer producing a formulation was associated with a decrease in prices of 2% (p<0.001) and 8% (p<0.001) for originator and generic formulations, respectively. The mean generic ARV price did not differ by country income level. Prices of originator ARVs were 48% (p<0.001) and 14% (p<0.001) higher in upper-middle income and lower-middle income countries compared to low income countries respectively, with the exception of South Africa, which had lower prices despite being an upper-middle income country. Conclusions: The donor funded pediatric ARV market as represented by the GPRM database is small, and lacks price competition. It is dominated by generic drugs due to the lower prices offered and the practicality of FDC formulations. This market requires continued donor support and the current initiatives to protect it are important to ensure market viability, especially if new formulations are to be introduced in the future.",
